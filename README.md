# Hey, I'm Frank Bria 👋

I build AI systems and help investors understand them.

**By day:** Principal Product Consultant at American Express, working on data governance and GL reconciliation at scale.

**By night:** Building in the AI tooling space. My [ralph-claude-code](https://github.com/frankbria/ralph-claude-code) project (autonomous agentic coding loops) has 6k+ stars and taught me more about where AI development is actually heading than any whitepaper.

**In a past life:** Founder/Co-Founder of Fintech startups. One of the creators of banking pricing optimization technology. Industry analyst at Tower Group (now Gartner), where I spent years telling banks what analytics/ML/AI technology actually mattered and telling vendors what banks actually needed. Author of [*Seven Billion Banks*](https://www.amazon.com/Seven-Billion-Banks-Personalized-Experience/dp/0985725435) on personalized banking.

- **[ralph-claude-code](https://github.com/frankbria/ralph-claude-code)** — Autonomous AI development framework with intelligent exit detection, rate limiting, and safety guardrails. The most-starred implementation in the agentic coding space.
- **[CodeFRAME](https://github.com/frankbria/codeframe)** — Next-gen multi-agent coding environment. AI swarms that plan, build, test, and deploy.
- **[SprintForge](https://github.com/frankbria/sprintforge)** — Project management with Monte Carlo simulations for probabilistic timeline predictions.

## The Other Stuff

I'm also a mathematician (algebraic topology, K-theory), a [composer](https://frankbriamusic.com) for film and media, and I speak German fluently plus enough Russian, French, and Italian to get into trouble.

I host [The 6 to 7 Figures Show](https://open.spotify.com/show/0xcYcgrzcnsff0mkNX0fGh) podcast and occasionally write about scaling consulting practices.
